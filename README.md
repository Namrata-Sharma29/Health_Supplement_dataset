2. **Python**
3. **PowerBI**

## 🧠 Strategic Frameworks Used

- **SWOT Analysis**
- **PESTLE Analysis**
- **Porter’s Five Forces**

The dataset used in this analysis contained sales records of supplement products across multiple months and geographies. Using Python and exploratory data analysis, the data was cleaned, processed, and evaluated to understand market size, product performance, pricing trends, and consumer behavior.

Geographically, the North American market displays the highest concentration of supplement consumption, supported by an already health-aware and fitness-engaged consumer base. Europe shows moderate but trust-driven adoption, where certifications and label transparency influence purchase decisions. Emerging markets show strong potential for expansion through e-commerce and localized health narratives.

Strategic frameworks such as SWOT, PESTLE, and Porter’s Five Forces were applied to understand the maturity and competitive intensity of the category. The market is competitive, with many similar SKUs and brands, high consumer comparison behavior, and strong dependence on credibility and ingredient transparency. However, increasing wellness awareness and rising disposable incomes continue to fuel growth.

From a go-to-market perspective, the recommended approach focuses on education-based marketing, credibility building through expert and influencer partnerships, and habit-forming subscription models. Seasonal campaigns aligned with fitness or immune health cycles can help brands position themselves more effectively. To support category penetration, it is important to integrate marketplace data such as prices, reviews, and stock availability (from platforms like Amazon and Walmart), followed by D2C store integration for understanding repeat purchasing behavior. Long-term differentiation can come from optional integration with health apps and wearable devices to enable personalized supplement recommendations.

Overall, the supplements market is a high-growth, recurring-purchase, digitally influenced category that aligns closely with the capabilities of competitive intelligence and market analytics platforms. The insights and trends uncovered in this project support a clear opportunity for data-driven positioning, strategic product monitoring, and forecast-based decision-making within this industry.
